Case Law

1. The property owner is responsible for buildings being irresponsibly built leading to death or other type of damage. [Law of Irresponsible building.][Section 1]

2. Discrimination as meant in chapter 2 section 7 in the constitution does not make laws that only apply to grongles unconstitutional. The misspelling of gronglets as "grongles" still makes the section apply to Gronglets.

3. Kidnapping of gronglets in chapter 2 section 3 of the criminal code does not apply when taking them from their home dimension.
